"""
Code submissions router — Module 6 (client-side execution only).

The browser (Pyodide/WASM in a Web Worker) has already executed the student's
code; this endpoint receives the output the client computed, compares it against
the hidden ExperimentEvaluationSpec, records the result and returns feedback.
Student code NEVER runs on this server.

Endpoints:
  POST  /code_submissions           record result of a client-executed submission (students only)
  GET   /code_submissions           list own submission history for an experiment
